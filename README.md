<h2>Motivation for the Project</h2>

In a Circuits 1 assignment, I got the opportunity to create a continuity tester, which would serve as the model for the continuity tester we design on Eagle and test using LTspice. I faced immense difficulty building this continuity tester due to it being my first time reading a data sheet for a component, but learning how to read a data served me well in my future projects and assignments since now I know where to make the appropriate connections with wires to get my desired output. 

Here specifically what required reading of a data sheet was the Texas Instruments LM358 op-amp since I had to identify the inverting and non inverting input for the continuity tester to work properly. The circuit I built here was also my first time working with an Arduino since prior I have only worked with Raspberry Pi, but it was simple to get adjusted since the programming involved is highly similar to C++.
